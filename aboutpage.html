    <h1>About Suzanna</h1>
    <br>
    <p>Suzanna has always had a passion for art. Like most kids she was introduced to drawing. It turned out she was a natural.
     She had a break from art until highschool where she specified in it. It was there she stared to develop her own style.
    As you can see she only paints with oil based paint. But, in her early days she experimentet with acryl and waterbased paint.
    All her previous work has been sold at galleries held by the school. Her previous success is a reason for her opening this online
    gallery.</p>
